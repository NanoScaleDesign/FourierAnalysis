\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Comment}
Until now we have been considering Fourier series which allows us to describe periodic phenomena. This can however cause issues, such as in challenge \ref{sec:fstexpform} when the function isn't actually periodic, since the derived fourier series results in periodicity outside the region of integration. The Fourier transform can help overcome this limitation and accurately describe signals which are non-periodic.

The suggested resources provide an excellent intuetive path to the connection between Fourier Series and Fourier Transforms, and this challenge is designed to give you the opportunity to take some time to try to understand the main concepts behind the transition.

\subsection*{Challenge}
Watch the two videos in the Resources section above, taking notes about the transition from Fourier Series to Fourier Analysis.

\section{Fourier transform of a window function}

\subsection*{Resources}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Book: Chapter 2.1, page 68, particularly at the bottom of the page (\url{https://see.stanford.edu/materials/lsoftaee261/book-fall-07.pdf})
    \item Video: Lecture 6 starting from 29:26 (\url{https://youtu.be/4lcvROAtN_Q?t=29m26s})
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Comments}
This challenge, and the next few, represent very common functions that can be evaluated using the Fourier transform. Try to understand the mathematics used in their evaluation (I will not expect you to be able to derive it starting Fourier series however, like Prof. Osgood does from page 65 onwards). The main learning concept is to understand how to use the Fourier Transform to convert between real-space and frequency-space.

In this and subsequent challenges, I list both reading resources and video. For this challenge up to and including challenge \ref{sec:shiftstretch}, I would suggest starting with the reading resources, and then if you have trouble understanding, to use the video resource for further support.

\subsection*{Challenge}
Calculate the Fourier Transform for the window function

\begin{equation}
    f(t)=
    \begin{cases}
        1 & \text{for } |t| < 1/2 \\
        0 & \text{for } |t| > 1/2
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}

In graph-form the function and its transform appear as follows:

\begin{tabular}{cc}
    \textbf{Function} & \textbf{Fourier transform} \\
    \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{window1.png} & \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{window1ft.png}
\end{tabular}

To check your answer, calculate $\hat{f}(s=1.5)$.

    \item Video lecture 8 from 1:56 to 11:20 (\url{https://youtu.be/wUT1huREHJM?t=1m56s})
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Challenge}
1. By delaying the window function slightly as shown below, we are introducing a phase-shift. Write a few sentences explaining what is meant by a phase-shift and how it relates to the current situation.

2. Calculate the Fourier Transform for the window function delayed by $1/100$ s, $1/10$ s and $1$ s.

3. Write a short summary of how the real and imaginary parts of the signal are changing as the delay increases. You considered the original window function in challenge \ref{sec:tophat}.

\begin{tabular}{c}
    \textbf{Function} \\
    \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{tophatdelay.png}

    \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{tophatdelayre.png} & \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{tophatdelayim.png}
\end{tabular}

To check your answer, calculate $\hat{f}(s=2.9)$ for each case. By doing this, you will also gain insight into the new nature of the real and imaginary parts of the function with shifting.

\subsection*{Solution}
$1/100$ s delay: $0.0333568 - 0.0061462i$

$1/10$ s delay: $-0.00843515 - 0.0328527i$

$1$ s delay: $0.0274405 + 0.0199367i$

\section{Fourier transform of a stretched triangle function}

    \item Video lecture 8 from 12:12 to 28:50 (\url{https://youtu.be/wUT1huREHJM?t=12m12s})
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Challenge}
Since this can be a little confusing, please be sure to fully read the listed resource and make sure you understand the reasoning and derivation.

A triangle function of general width can be defined as

\begin{equation}
    f(at)=
    \begin{cases}
        1 - a|t| & \text{for } a|t| < 1\\
        0 & \text{otherwise}
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}

1. In challenge \ref{sec:ft_triangle} the base-width of the triangle was $2$ (ie, $1-(-1)$) and the half-base-width was $1$ (ie, $1-0$). What is the half-base-width for a triangle when $a=2$ and $a=1/2$?

2. Calculate the Fourier Transform $\hat{f}(s)$ for the case where the width of the triangle-function is doubled. To check your answer, evaluate the transform at $s=0.1$.

3. Write a few sentences explaining how stretching and squeezing in the time-domain is related to stretching and squeezing in the frequency domain.

\subsection*{Solution}
1.\\
$a=2$: \hash{iii}{e8cb88}\\
$a=1/2$: \hash{jjj}{eb8c63}\\

2. $\hat{f}(0.1)=1.75$

During the past few challenges we have been considering various transforms of common functions. The ability to utilise such transforms; and generate your own manipulations of them; can be very useful for applications related to filtering.

\subsection*{Challenge}
Show that the Fourier Transform of the function $f(at\pm b)$ can be given by
