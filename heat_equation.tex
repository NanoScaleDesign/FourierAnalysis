Determine $u_t$ and $u_{xx}$ for the equation

\begin{equation}
    u(x,t) = 5tx^2 + 3t - x
\end{equation}

To check your answer, substitute $x=3$ and $t=2$ into your answers, as appropriate.

\subsection*{Solution}
$u_t$: \hash{ww}{7901cb}

$u_{xx}$: \hash{xx}{6aba1c}

\section{Heat equation: Periodicity}

\subsection*{Resources}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Lecture 4 from 37:00 onwards: (\url{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5lBM7nn2eA}), continuing at the start of lecture 5 (\url{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5qRpgfQld4})
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Comment}
Please follow the derivation of the heat equation shown in the videos in lectures 4-5. This use of Fourier series is a great example of how the relatively abstract mathematical concepts covered by the course so-far can have real physical applications in science and engineering.

\subsection*{Challenge}
Add the points of the following true statements concerning a heated ring with circumference 1 and temperature distribution described by $u(x,t)$:

1 point: $\displaystyle u(x,t) = u(x,t)$

2 points: $\displaystyle u(x,t) = u(x,t+1)$

4 points: $\displaystyle u(x,t) = u(x,t+2)$

8 points: $\displaystyle u(x,t) = u(x+1,t)$

16 points: $\displaystyle u(x,t) = u(x+1,t+1)$

32 points: $\displaystyle u(x,t) = u(x+1,t+2)$

64 points: $\displaystyle u(x,t) = u(x+2,t)$

128 points: $\displaystyle u(x,t) = u(x+2,t+1)$

256 points: $\displaystyle u(x,t) = u(x+2,t+2)$

512 points: The temperature distribution is periodic in space but not time

1024 points: The temperature distribution is periodic in time but not space

2048 points: The temperature distribution is periodic in both space and time

4096 points: The temperature distribution is periodic neither in space nor time

\section{Heat equation: Fourier coefficients}
\label{sec:heateqnfc}

\subsection*{Resources}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Lecture 4 from 37:00 onwards: (\url{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5lBM7nn2eA}), continuing at the start of lecture 5 (\url{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5qRpgfQld4})
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Challenge}
Starting from the heat (diffusion) equation $u_t = u_{xx}/2$, show that the Fourier coefficient at time $t$ is given by

\begin{equation}
    C_k(t) = C_k(0) e^{-2 \pi^2 k^2 t}
\end{equation}


\subsection*{Solution}
Compare with your peers during discussion time and please ask if there is anything you do not understand.

\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Comment}
Note that the exponential in the answer for $B(t)$ is negative, leading to a decay to mean ambient temperature over time (you can think of the temperature $u(x,t)$ as the temperature relative to the surrounding environment rather than absolute temperature measured in Kelvin).

\subsection*{Challenge}
Write the heat equation and its Fourier coefficient in the form below. Identify A(x), B(t) and C(x). To check your answers, substitute $k=1$, $x=2$ and $t=3$ into the expressions (purely for checking the solution; these numbers have no physical basis).
% This is not ideal because it doesn't distinguish negative signs

\begin{equation}
    \hat{f}(k) = \int_0^1 A(x) f(x) dx
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    u(x,t) = \sum_{k=-\infty}^{k=\infty} \hat{f}(k) B(t) C(x)
\end{equation}

\subsection*{Solution}
A: \hash{zz}{ffef92}

% So we have a fourier series in space (with FC's given by C_k when t=0) that decays over time
% Note f^(k) is the equivalent of c_k
% Calculate the heat around a ring
