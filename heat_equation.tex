\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Comment}
Here we can learn about an application of Fourier series to solve partial differential equations. This problem was one of the motivations for Fourier to develop the idea of Fourier series.

The motivation for the equation $u_t = \frac{1}{2} u_{xx}$ described in the notes is complicated somewhat by the interpretation in terms of equivalences between electrical and thermal capacitance. If this is not so clear then don't worry about it. At a minimum you should understand the following:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Heat flow is proportional to the gradient of the temperature.
    \item Heat accumulates within a unit volume when the rate of heat flow into that volume is greater than the rate of heat flow out of that volume.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Challenge}
The following statements concern a heated ring with circumference 1 and temperature distribution described by $u(x,t)$. Add the points of the statements that are defined by the system to be true:

1 point: $\displaystyle u(x,t) = u(x,t)$

2 points: $\displaystyle u(x,t) = u(x,t+1)$

4 points: $\displaystyle u(x,t) = u(x,t+2)$

8 points: $\displaystyle u(x,t) = u(x+1,t)$

16 points: $\displaystyle u(x,t) = u(x+1,t+1)$

32 points: $\displaystyle u(x,t) = u(x+1,t+2)$

64 points: $\displaystyle u(x,t) = u(x+2,t)$

128 points: $\displaystyle u(x,t) = u(x+2,t+1)$

256 points: $\displaystyle u(x,t) = u(x+2,t+2)$

512 points: The temperature distribution is periodic in space but not time

1024 points: The temperature distribution is periodic in time but not space

2048 points: The temperature distribution is periodic in both space and time

4096 points: The temperature distribution is periodic neither in space nor time

\subsection*{Challenge}
Starting from the heat (diffusion) equation $u_t = u_{xx}/2$, show that the general solution to the heat equation on a ring is given by
\begin{equation}
    u(x,t) = \sum_{n=-\infty}^{n=\infty} c_n(0) e^{-2 \pi^2 n^2 t} e^{i 2 \pi n x}
\end{equation}
and write an expression for $c_n(0)$ in terms of the initial temperature distribution $u(x,0)$.

\subsection*{Solution}
Please compare with your peers during discussion time and ask if there is anything you do not understand.

\section{Heat equation on a ring: calculation}
\label{sec:heateqn}

\subsection*{Comment}
Remember that any integer multiple of $2 \pi$ in the complex exponential (eg, $e^{i 4 \pi}$ or $e^{i 2 \pi n}$ where $n$ is an integer) is equivalent to having $2 \pi$ in the exponential due to the periodic nature of complex exponentials (ie, that $e^{i 2 \pi} = \cos(2 \pi) + i \sin(2 \pi)$ and $\cos(2 \pi) = \cos(4 \pi) = \cos(6 \pi)$ etc).

\subsection*{Challenge}
Consider an initial heat distribution around a ring. Relative to ambient temperature, the initial temperature distribution follows a cosine distribution with the peak temperature at $x=0$. Assume that the ring has a circumference length of 1 unit.

1. Write an expression for the initial relative temperature distribution, $u(x,0)$.

2. Write an expression for the relative temperature distribution, $u(x,t)$, as a function of time.

\emph{Note: You may use a computer-algebra system such as Wolfram Alpha to help you do the necessary integrals.}

You can see an animation of the solution here:\\
\url{https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NanoScaleDesign/FourierAnalysis/master/Images/cosrelax.gif}

\subsection*{Solution}
1. You should find that your temperature distribution satisfies the result $u(0.2,0) = 0.309$.

2. To check your answer you may substitute $x=0.3$ and $t=0.01$ into your solution: $u(0.3,0.01) = -0.25$
