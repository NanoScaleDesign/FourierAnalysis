Deduce in a simple way the Fourier coefficients $a_1$ and $b_1$ in the Fourier series
\begin{equation}
    \sum_{k=1}^{N} a_k cos(2 \pi k t) + b_k sin(2 \pi k t)

\begin{equation}
    \sum_{k=1}^{N} A_k sin(2 \pi k t + \phi_k)
\end{equation}

for the following cases:
\begin{enumerate}

\subsection*{Comment}
Many textbooks will work in terms of ``Fourier sine series'' and ``Fourier cosine series''. For a function that is perfectly even or odd, it is possible to write a Fourier series using one of these two forms. There are direct approaches to calculating sine and cosine Fourier series, in contrast to the route taken here via the exponential form. We will continue to work in the exponential form however, since not only does this provide a deeper understanding, but you can always easily switch between exponential and trigonometric forms if you really want to.

Re-write the series obtained in challenge \ref{sec:fstexpform} in terms of a trigonometric infinite series.

It is important to understand why some series are infinite, while others are not (well, technically all series are infinite since they all involve sums to $n=\infty$, however for some series the Fourier coefficients are all zero above a certain value of $n$). Therefore, make sure you understand why the answer is as it is, below. If you don't, be sure to discuss with others.

The Fourier series is a sum to $\pm \infty$, however in some cases the coefficients ($C_k$'s) are zero beyond a certain number of terms. Which of the terms below will have Fourier coefficients that are all zero after a certain number of terms? Sum the points of these functions.

\section{Direct trigonometric calculation of a Fourier series: the coefficients}
\label{sec:fs_squarewave}

\section*{Comment}
This challenge introduces several key concepts at once, including decoupling of integral intervals and periodicity, the concept of a square wave and direct trigonometric evaluation of Fourier series. If you can master this you'll be in a really strong position.

It is hopefully clear now that for real signals, due to the symmetry of the positive and negative k's, one can fully compose Fourier series in terms of sine and cosine. In challenge \ref{sec:trigexpconvert} we saw the formula for the function in terms of Fourier coefficients $a_0$, $a_n$ and $b_n$. While we will not use this approach, it is important to be able to utilise such a formulation since this is the way some books present it and some people have learnt it. Therefore, without proof, the coefficients can be calculated using

\begin{equation}
    a_k = \frac{2}{T} \int_{t_0}^{t_0+T} f(t) Cos(2 \pi k t/T)
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    b_k = \frac{2}{T} \int_{t_0}^{t_0+T} f(t) Sin(2 \pi k t/T)
\end{equation}

\subsection*{Challenge}
Using the direct trigonometric Fourier series, obtain a general expression for the $a_k$ and $b_k$ coefficients for the square-wave signal with periodicity 4

\begin{equation}
    f(t)=
    \begin{cases}
        1 & \text{for } -1<t<1 \\
        0 & \text{for } 1<t<3
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}

A graph of the function, including the solution for various values of $n$, is shown here:

\includegraphics{fs_square_wave.png}

Note the symmetry of the problem. Can you see what terms will be zero? To check your solution, calculate $a_k$ and $b_k$ for $k=0$, $k=2$ and $k=3$. Also note that you will have to break the integrals into two parts and sum them in order to tackle this problem.
