\section{Introduction to sine and cosine Fourier coefficients}
\label{sec:trigcoeff}

\subsection*{Comment}
Fourier series involves the construction of a signal by summing multiple periodic signals and careful choice of each frequency's amplitude and phase. For example, considering the following 3 signals:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $f_1(t) = 2 \sin(2 \pi t)$
    \item $f_2(t) = 1 \sin(4 \pi t + \pi)$
    \item $f_3(t) = 0.3 \sin(6 \pi t + \pi/5)$
\end{enumerate}
Their sum (k = 1 to 3) produces a much more complex shape:

\includegraphics{signal_buildup.png}

Here we will consider Fourier sine and cosine series. We will go beyond this description later, but you should be aware of their existance and a method of their derivation.

\subsection*{Challenge}
As shown above, a complex function (signal) can be made up of a sum of sine signals:
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:fssinonly}
    f(t) = A_0 + \sum_{k=1}^{N} A_k \sin(2 \pi k t + \phi_k)
\end{equation}

Using basic trigonomatric relations, show that this can be re-written in terms of a sum of sines and cosines:
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:fssincos}
    f(t) = \frac{a_0}{2} + \sum_{k=1}^{N} a_k \cos(2 \pi k t) + b_k \sin(2 \pi k t)
\end{equation}

I want you to see how the phase information is encoded in the representation of equation \ref{eq:fssincos}. $a_k$ and $b_k$ are referred to as Fourier coefficients. Write an expression for the coefficients $a_k$, $b_k$ and $a_0$.

\subsection*{Solutions}
To check your answer, calculate $a_0$, $a_1$ and $b_1$ given the following information:\\
$A_0=-1/2$, $A_1 = 0.7$, $\phi_1 = \pi/5$.

(make sure your calculator is using radians)

$a_1 = 0.41145$, $b_1 = 0.566312$.

\section{An alternative way to write Fourier series}
\label{sec:expfs}

\subsection*{Comments}
It turns out that a more mathematically-convenient and ultimately intuitive way to write Fourier series is in terms of complex exponentials in the form
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:fsexp}
    f(t) = \sum_{k=-n}^{k=n} c_k e^{i 2 \pi k t}
\end{equation}

A few things to note:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The sum now runs from $-n$ to $n$.
    \item The $k=0$ term that was originally excluded from the sum in equation \ref{eq:fssincos} is now included.
    \item The $c_k$'s, unlike the $a_k$'s and $b_k$'s, are complex.
    \item $c_{-k} = \bar{c_k}$.
    \item $c_0 = a_0/2$.
\end{itemize}

You see how we started with equation \ref{eq:fssinonly} and now end up with equation \ref{eq:fsexp}? Do you see more-or-less how the phase information is encoded in the $c_k$'s?

\subsection*{Challenge}
1. By comparing equation \ref{eq:fssincos} to equation \ref{eq:fsexp}, write $c_k$ in terms of $a_k$ and $b_k$ for $k<0$ and $k>0$.

2. Show that $c_{-k} = \bar{c_k}$

\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Comment}
Until now we considered signals with periodicity 1, but this will not always be the case, and in fact as we make the jump from Fourier series to Fourier transforms this will become more important. The resource gives the intuition behind the non-periodic case for complex Fourier series. For trigonometric Fourier series, the Fourier coefficients become:
\begin{equation}
    a_k = \frac{2}{T} \int_{t_0}^{t_0+T} f(t) \cos(2 \pi k t/T) dt
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    b_k = \frac{2}{T} \int_{t_0}^{t_0+T} f(t) \sin(2 \pi k t/T) dt
\end{equation}

while for complex Fourier series the Fourier coefficients become:
\begin{equation}
    c_k = \frac{1}{T} \int_{t_0}^{t_0+T} f(t) e^{-i 2 \pi kt/T} dt
\end{equation}

\subsection*{Comment}
In the first lecture we saw how it was possible to approximate any function given enough circles. Here we link what you have learned back to that first lecture. I strongly recommend viewing the fun and informative videos listed here under Resources. In summary, by building a Fourier series you are representing a function using an orthonormal basis, where each component of the basis can be considered visually as a circle operating with individual radius and frequency on the real-imaginary plane.

\subsection*{Challenge}
Treating the x-axis as the real axis and the y-axis as the imaginary axis, arrange the equations below in the following order:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item A point moving round on a circle with radius 2 units and frequency 2 Hz
    \item A point moving round on a circle with radius 3 units and frequency 1 Hz
    \item A point moving round on a circle with radius 2 units and a period of 1 second
    \item A point moving round on a circle with radius 3 units and a period of 2 seconds
\end{enumerate}

Equations:

$\displaystyle A e^{2 \pi i k t}$ where $t$ is time in seconds and the values of $A$ and $k$ are as follows:

A: $A=2$, $k=2$ 

B: $A=3$, $k=1$

C: $A=3$, $k=0.5$

D: $A=2$, $k=1$
