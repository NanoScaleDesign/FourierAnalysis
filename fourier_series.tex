\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Comment}
Since cosine and sine can be written in terms of exponentials, it is possible to switch between Fourier series that are expressed in terms of exponentials and Fourier series that are expressed in terms of sines and cosines. Many textbooks will actually work in terms of these trigonometric forms. Where only sine terms are involved, it is called a ``Fourier sine series'' and where only cosines are involved it's termed a ``Fourier cosine series''. The series have coefficients $a_0$, $a_k$ and $b_k$, in the following fashion:

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:fsoftintrigform}
    f(t) = \frac{a_0}{2} + \sum_{k=1}^{k=N} a_k cos(2 \pi k t) + b_k sin(2 \pi k t)
\end{equation}

Note that the sum here goes from $k=1$ to $k=N$, in contrast to the exponential form of Fourier series which goes between $k=\pm N$.

\subsection*{Challenge}
1. Write $sin(x)$ in the form of an exponential sum:
\begin{equation}
    sin(x)=\sum_{k=-N}^{k=N} f(k) e^{g(k,x)}
\end{equation}
Your answer in challenge \ref{sec:fcsinx} may help you.

What is $f(k)$, $g(k,x)$ and $N$? To check your answers for $f(k)$ and $g(k,x)$, substitute $k=1$ and $x=2$ as appropriate into your expressions for $f(k)$ and $g(k,x)$.

2. By converting from an exponential-form sum ($\sum_{k=-N}^{k=N}$) to a trigonometric-form sum ($\sum_{k=1}^{k=N}$), re-write the series obtained in challenge \ref{sec:fstexpform} in terms of a trigonometric infinite series (ie, using sines and cosines). To check your answer, evaluate the Fourier series with $N=1$ with $t=0.8$ and ensure that you get the same answer as you did for challenge \ref{sec:fstexpform}.
% NT: Put re-arranging practise into another challenge and make it in more depth (cosines, and both directions). Otherwise students try to use formula instead. Need practise about switching from sums from -infty to sums from 1

\section{Direct trigonometric calculation of a Fourier series: the coefficients}
\label{sec:fs_squarewave}
% NT: Need practise about integration over intervals

\section*{Comment}
This challenge introduces several key concepts at once, including decoupling of integral intervals and periodicity, the concept of a square wave and direct trigonometric evaluation of Fourier series. If you can master this you'll be in a really strong position.

It is hopefully clear now that for real signals, due to the symmetry of the positive and negative k's, one can fully compose Fourier series in terms of sine and cosine. In challenge \ref{sec:trigexpconvert} we saw the formula for the function in terms of Fourier coefficients $a_0$, $a_n$ and $b_n$. While we will not use this approach, it is important to be able to utilise such a formulation since this is the way some books present it and some people have learnt it. Therefore, without proof, the coefficients can be calculated using

\begin{equation}
    a_k = \frac{2}{T} \int_{t_0}^{t_0+T} f(t) Cos(2 \pi k t/T)
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    b_k = \frac{2}{T} \int_{t_0}^{t_0+T} f(t) Sin(2 \pi k t/T)
\end{equation}

\subsection*{Challenge}
Using the direct trigonometric Fourier series, obtain a general expression for the $a_k$ and $b_k$ coefficients for the square-wave signal with periodicity 4:

\begin{equation}
    f(t)=
    \begin{cases}
        1 & \text{for } -1<t<1 \\
        0 & \text{for } 1<t<3
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}

Note the symmetry of the problem. Can you see what terms will be zero? To check your solution, calculate $a_k$ and $b_k$ for $k=0$, $k=2$ and $k=3$. Note that you will have to break the integrals into two parts and sum them in order to tackle this problem.

A graph of the function, including the solution for various values of $n$, is shown here:

\subsection*{Comment}
The previous challenges have focussed on the orthogonality and orthonormality of vectors. We now make the jump to functions. As chapter 1.9 explains, although its not perfect, the analogy between vectors and functions is a good way to help understand and visualise the role that the terms of a Fourier series play in defining a basis upon which to describe a function.

\subsection*{Challenge}
Starting from the inner product of two terms ($e^{2 \pi i k_1 t}$, $e^{2 \pi i k_2 t}$) of a Fourier series, demonstrate that the terms of a Fourier series form an orthonormal basis. \textbf{Show a full derivation}.

To check your intuition, you may evaluate the following cases:

$X = (e^{2 \pi i k_1 t}, e^{2 \pi i k_1 t})$

$Y = (e^{2 \pi i k_1 t}, e^{2 \pi i k_2 t})$

\subsection*{Solution}
If you are not confident about your derivation, please check with someone else. If there is any step that you do not fully understand, do not hesitate to ask. If you do not understand the connection between previous challenges on vectors and this challenge using functions, do not hesitate to ask someone.

\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Comment}
In the first lecture we saw how it was possible to approximate any function given enough circles. Here we link what you have learned back to that first lecture. I strongly recommend viewing the fun and informative videos listed here under Resources. In summary, by building a Fourier series you are representing a function using an orthonormal basis, where each component of the basis can be considered visually as a circle operating with individual radius and frequency on the real-imaginary plane. If, after completing this challenge, that last sentence makes sense to you, then you have achieved the first major goal of this course.

\subsection*{Challenge}
Treating the x-axis as the real axis and the y-axis as the imaginary axis, arrange the equations below in the following order:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item A point moving round on a circle with radius 2 units and frequency 2 Hz
    \item A point moving round on a circle with radius 3 units and frequency 1 Hz
    \item A point moving round on a circle with radius 2 units and a period of 1 second
    \item A point moving round on a circle with radius 3 units and a period of 2 seconds
\end{enumerate}

Equations:

$\displaystyle A e^{2 \pi i k t}$ where $t$ is time in seconds and the values of $A$ and $k$ are as follows:

A: $A=2$, $k=2$ 

B: $A=3$, $k=1$

C: $A=3$, $k=0.5$

D: $A=2$, $k=1$

\section{Gibb's phenomenon}

    \item Book: 1.18 (\url{https://see.stanford.edu/materials/lsoftaee261/book-fall-07.pdf})
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Challenge}
Write a few sentences summarising your understanding of what Gibb's phenomenon is. By what percentage does overshoot of a discontinuity of a square-wave function occur?

\emph{The full derivation is beyond the scope of this course, so it is not necessary to understand the (rather complex) derivation in the notes. The aim of this challenge is simply to enable you to be able to describe qualitatively what Gibb's phenomenon is using a few sentences, and know the amount of overshoot in the case of a standard square-wave. No maths expected.}
