# Fourier Analysis
This is course material for the Fourier Analysis course held at Kyushu University during Autumn 2016.
The students learn by utilising freely-available online content to work through challenges contained in a PDF file.
The intention is to take the students from "beginner" to "experienced" by working through the challenges in sequence.

The latest version of the PDF can be downloaded [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NanoScaleDesign/FourierAnalysis/master/fourier_analysis.pdf).

The course is still being developed and is work-in-progress.
Suggestions and corrections are very welcome. Content is licensed with creative-commons *CC BY-NC 4.0*.

This would not have been possible without the free content made available online; most-notably that by Prof. Brad Osgood of Stanford University.
