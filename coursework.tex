\subsection{Task}
There are many interesting things about Fourier analysis, whether in terms of the mathematics or applications.
This coursework aims to give you the opportunity to follow areas related to your own interest in the subject.

Your task is to explore a topic related to Fourier analysis. This could involve:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Exploring the characteristics of a real-world signal using application of \emph{Fourier analysis and programming}, and drawing interesting insights into the signal, or
    \item Exploring an area of mathematics related to Fourier analysis that was not covered by the course, or
    \item Exploring an area of mathematics related to Fourier analysis that was touched on by the course, but going into further depth.
\end{itemize}


Points will be awarded on the basis of creativity, demonstration of knowledge, quality of explanation and accuracy.

\subsection{Submission}
Your submission should contain:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Either text (guideline: 2 to 4 pages) or video (guideline: 10 minutes)
    \item A list of references (either included in the text or submitted with the video)
    \item Challenges with their fully-worked solutions (ie, not just the final answer) (guideline: 2 challenges)
\end{itemize}

Submission is electronic, and may be in text or video format. For text-based formats, submission may be in any format, including PDF, LibreOffice, MS Word, Google docs, Latex, etc\ldots If you submit a PDF, please also submit the source-files used to generate the PDF. For video-based formats, please provide a link to the video either for viewing or download. Challenges and their solutions should be submitted in written form, even if a video is submitted.

For submission you will need to do both of the following things:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Submit the materials by \textbf{email} to the teacher \textbf{before the class on 23 January 2019} with the subject ``[\coursenospace] Coursework'' and
    \item In addition, bring a paper copy to class that you can share with others in the class.
\end{itemize}

I will confirm in the class that I received your coursework. If you cannot attend the class, you must request confirmation of receipt when you send the email.

Late submission:\\
By 17:00 on 24 January 2019: 90\% of the final mark.\\
By 17:00 on 30 January 2019: 50\% of the final mark.\\
Later submissions cannot be considered.
